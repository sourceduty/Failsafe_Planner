   - **Mitigation Strategy:** Conduct comprehensive market research including competitor analysis, customer surveys, and trend analysis.

2. **Inadequate Product Testing**
   - **Historic Example:** Samsung Galaxy Note 7 battery explosions due to insufficient testing.
   - **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement rigorous multi-phase testing (alpha, beta, and stress tests) to identify and fix defects before launch.

3. **Poor Project Management**
   - **Historic Example:** Boeing 737 MAX delays and issues due to project management failures.
   - **Mitigation Strategy:** Adopt Agile project management techniques with regular sprints, reviews, and clear milestones.

4. **Ineffective Marketing Strategy**
   - **Historic Example:** New Coke’s failed marketing campaign which alienated its core consumers.
   - **Mitigation Strategy:** Develop a well-researched marketing plan with a focus on target demographics, value propositions, and phased marketing efforts.

5. **Supply Chain Disruptions**
   - **Historic Example:** COVID-19 pandemic causing global supply chain breakdowns.
   - **Mitigation Strategy:** Establish multiple suppliers, maintain a buffer inventory, and have contingency plans for supply chain disruptions.

#### Step 3: Develop a Detailed Action Plan
1. **Market Research**
   - Conduct surveys and focus groups.
   - Analyze competitors’ strengths and weaknesses.
   - Use analytics tools to predict market trends.

2. **Product Development and Testing**
   - Develop prototypes and conduct internal testing.
   - Perform beta testing with a select group of customers.
   - Implement feedback and conduct final stress tests.

3. **Project Management**
   - Set up an Agile project management framework.
   - Define clear milestones and deliverables.
   - Hold regular sprint reviews and adjust plans as necessary.

4. **Marketing and Promotion**
   - Create a comprehensive marketing plan targeting specific customer segments.
   - Develop promotional materials and plan a phased release.
   - Engage with influencers and early adopters for product endorsements.

5. **Supply Chain Management**
   - Identify and establish relationships with multiple suppliers.
   - Maintain a safety stock of critical components.
   - Develop contingency plans for potential supply chain issues.

#### Step 4: Monitor and Review
- **Regular Reviews:** Schedule bi-weekly project review meetings to assess progress and address issues.
- **Feedback Mechanism:** Set up a feedback loop with customers and stakeholders to identify and resolve issues promptly.
- **Risk Assessment:** Continuously monitor for new risks and update the failsafe plan accordingly.

#### Step 5: Post-Launch Evaluation
- **Performance Analysis:** Assess the product’s performance against initial goals (market share, customer satisfaction, defect rates).
- **Lessons Learned:** Conduct a post-mortem analysis to understand what worked and what didn’t.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Use insights from the evaluation to improve future product launches and refine the failsafe plan.

#### Conclusion
By learning from historic business planning errors and implementing these strategies, the tech company can significantly reduce the risk of failure and increase the chances of a successful product launch.

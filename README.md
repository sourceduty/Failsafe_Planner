- **Feedback Mechanism:** Set up a feedback loop with customers and stakeholders to identify and resolve issues promptly.
- **Risk Assessment:** Continuously monitor for new risks and update the failsafe plan accordingly.

#### Step 5: Post-Launch Evaluation
- **Performance Analysis:** Assess the product’s performance against initial goals (market share, customer satisfaction, defect rates).
- **Lessons Learned:** Conduct a post-mortem analysis to understand what worked and what didn’t.
